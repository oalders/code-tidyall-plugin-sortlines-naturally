Revision history for Code-TidyAll-Plugin-SortLines-Naturally

{{$NEXT}}
    - Switches from Sort::Naturally to Unicode::Collate::Locale in order to be
      able to force an encoding on the repository.  Sort::Naturally isn't
      configurable in this way and leads to issues if devs with different
      locales start sorting and committing. (Greg Oschwald)
